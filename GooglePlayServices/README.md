Google Play Services
====================

This solution uses the Xamarin Google Play Services NuGet to demonstrate a few uses of
the maps API included within Google Play Services.

You will need to add your own Google Maps API key
in the Android Manifest.xml file for this sample to run correctly.

For information on obtaining a Google Maps API key, see:
